# Full-Stack Engineer Notes
### <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/full-stack-engineer" target="_blank">Course by Codecademy</a>

I write my notes here as I progress through the career path.

I've organized this with the intention of using it as a knowledgebase later on when I need a refresher.
Therefore the repo structure will ***not*** perfectly match the course structure outlined below. In addition, I will be making changes as I go through the course.

Some parts of my notes use wording that makes more sense to me, while others are the explanations as provided in the course. I try to add examples whenever possible but some concepts just don't need code examples or are too similar to something already noted.
