Grid systems help organize designs and provide a series of guidelines to properly align elements on a page. Using this visual layout system can help easily define the space needed between elements, while creating content that guides the user on how to navigate the web page.

# Grid Types

The most common type of grid for web design is the column grid. It breaks up a page into vertical units that span the width of the content.
