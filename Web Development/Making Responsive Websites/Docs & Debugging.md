You can find the documentation for CSS at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Network</a>. 
In addition to CSS, The Mozilla Developer Network (referred to as MDN) contains the complete documentation for HTML, JavaScript, and many other essential tools of web development.

As a general rule if you don't know something - Google it or check Stack Overflow. 
AI tools also come in handy for finding information quickly. 

Do **NOT** rely on AI to write code! Only to find information and ask it for links to the sources.
