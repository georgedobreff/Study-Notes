Semantic means "relating to meaning" so semantic elements provide information about the content between the tags. We prefer elements based on their meaning not on how they're presented. For example, instead of using ```<div>``` for the header we can use ```<header>```.

# Header & Nav

- The ```<header>``` is a container for navigational links or titles. It's a header.. 

- The ```<nav>``` is used to define a block of navigational links such as menus and tables of contents.

# Main & Footer

- ```<main>``` is used to encapsulate the dominant content within a page.

- ```<footer>``` is for the content at the bottom of the page and usually contains contact info, copyright, sitemap, etc.

# Article & Section

- ```<section>``` defines similar elements like articles on the same topic.
- ```<article>``` kinda self-explanatory. Can hold articles, blogs, commments, magazines, etc.

# Aside

The ```<aside>``` element is used to mark additional information that can enhance another element but isn't required to understand the main content.

# Figure & Figcaption

```<figure>``` ecapsulates media like an image, illustration, diagram, chart, code snippet, etc.
```<figcaption>``` adds a caption below the figure to describe it.

# Audio
```<audio>``` is very similar to the video element but it adds an audio file. Still uses the *src* attribute but we also specify the *type="audio/format*
We can add *autoplay* and *controls* too.

# Video
This was covered in the Elements part. Some additional attributes to it are *loop* and *autoplay*.

# Embed
Obsolete. Could be used to embed any media type but we don't use it.
