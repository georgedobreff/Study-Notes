Arrays are basically lists. They can store any data type and like lists they are ***ordered***, meaning each item has a numbered position.

```JS
let newYearsResolutions = ['Keep a journal', 'Take a falconry class', 'Learn to juggle'];
```

# Creating an Array

One way we can create an array is to use an **array literal**. An array literal creates an array by wrapping items in square brackets [].

### Letâ€™s take a closer look at this array example:

* The array is represented by the square brackets [] and the content inside.
* Each content item inside an array is called an **element**.
* Each element is separated by a comma.
* There are three different elements inside the array.
* Each element inside the array is a different data type.

We can also save an array to a variable like in the first code example above.
